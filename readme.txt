Profiless is a plugin that removes access to the profile page for the subscriber level user.

== Description ==

This plugin is very simple! It removes the menu icon to access the profile page for the level 0 user in wordpress admin pannel. It also redirects the level 0 user to the admin
homepage if it tries to access directly the profile page (as the menuitem has been removed).

== Installation ==

This plugin is plug and play! Once you have turned it on, it will be in action! Just copy the file to the plugin directory of your wordpress installation then activate and that's it!
